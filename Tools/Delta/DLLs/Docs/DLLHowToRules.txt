Anthony Savidis, 2008.
THE FOLLOWING RULES ARE ADEQAUTE TO CREATE DLLs

1. Never export templates (classes or functions).
2. Never have inline methods accessing static class data in exported classes (move implementation in the cpp).
3. Use 'extern "C"' in export / import only for DLLs loaded after initiation, having procs taken by name.
4. Never export classes having ONLY inline methods (whether static or not).
5. Never export interfaces (i.e., classes with only pure virtual methods and inline ctor / dctor).
6. Assume a DLL is an executable for link dependencies.
7. A DLL to produce its .lib file it must export something.
