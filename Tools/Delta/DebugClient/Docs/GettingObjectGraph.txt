Explanations on getting object graph.
**************************************************

There are two ways to extract an object graph: (i) assuming a
directed graph, meaning 'depth' parameter is used to count path length 
by following *only* outgoing edges; and (ii) assuming an undirected
graph, where the 'depth' parameter counts path length by following
either incoming or outgoing edges.

Either way, the object graph retains internally, in object slots, 
information allowing identify all directed edges.

Finally, the expression that is provided to the debugger backend for 
extracting the object graph is of special importance to frontend 
developers since it is seen as the starting node of the graph. There
is a pseudo node in the graph with id "_<STARTNODE>_" having a single
slot with key "_<STARTNODEABSREF>_" and value the id of this starting node.
