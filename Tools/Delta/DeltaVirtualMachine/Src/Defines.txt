Special cpp flags for the Delta virtual machine.
**************************************************

The following names may be optionally defined (cpp) when building 
the virtual machine (by default they are not defined).

DELTA_ENABLE_ASSIGNMENT_AND_RETURN_WARNINGS
	This flag enables the following runtime checks, all of which issue
	a respective warning, for assignments and function return values:
	*	Function returning an undefined value
	*	Getting (using in an expr) an undefined value returned by a function
	*	Assigning a variable to itself (self assignment)
	*	Assigning an undefined value to a variable (if the previous applies
		this test is skipped)

DELTA_SUICIDAL_VM_ERROR
	Through this flag you enable posting of a runtime error when the currently 
	executing vm deletes somehow (Delta / C++ embedding) itself.
	
DELTA_ZOMBIE_VM_ERROR
	Through this flag you enable posting of a runtime error when the currently 
	executing vm deletes somehow (Delta / C++ embedding) a caller vm. Because
	a caller's (outer) execution loop is beneath the current vm in the callstack,
	the result is to have an active execution loop of a zombi vm. 
	
	In case the flag is undefined, the Delta vm handles zombie vms gracefully 
	by instantly exiting their execution loops when the runtime control returns
	back to them after the callees are popped.
