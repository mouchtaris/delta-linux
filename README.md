# Delta-Linux

This is a mirror of the [Delta language](http://www.ics.forth.gr/hci/files/plang/Delta/Delta.html) for UNIX/Linux systems.

The `master` branch mirrors the SVN repository, which can be found on the official website.

The `linux` branch applies minor rafactorings to the master branch, so that it can compile under UNIX/Linux and GNU GCC without any errors (and some warnings).

The licence for acquiring, using, modifying and redistributing these sources can be found at the official website. This repository is a mere mirror.

Current maintainer for the linux branch: Nikos Mouchtaris <mouchtaris@gmail.com>.
