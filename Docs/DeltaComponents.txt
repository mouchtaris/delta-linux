Reference for Delta Components
*************************************************

Each Delta Component is implemented as a single script that provides the code
for both the component class as well as the component instances.

The code for the component class may contain:

TASK			|	FUNCTION_NAME
--------------------------------------------------
class loading 		|	ClassLoad
class unloading 	|	ClassUnload
static initialization	|	Initialize
static cleanup		|	CleanUp
static functions	|	(user defined)
static member functions*|	(user defined)
static handlers		|	(user defined)
static member handlers*	|	(user defined)
static commands		|	(user defined)
static member commands*	|	(user defined)

* The static members are actually member functions that are provided by default by the class
  and consist of static functions taking the instance as a first argument.

The code for the component instances may contain:

TASK			|	FUNCTION_NAME
--------------------------------------------------
constructor		|	Constructor
destructor		|	Destructor
gui generation		|	GenerateWindow
member functions	|	(user defined)
dynamic functions	|	(user defined)
member handlers		|	(user defined)
dynamic handlers	|	(user defined)
member commands		|	(user defined)
dynamic commands	|	(user defined)

The sequence is as follows:
When loading a component the ClassLoad function is invoked to perform the component registration.
The ClassLoad function should contain static function/handler/command registrations as well as 
image registrations for the component class.
Within its body there should also be an invocation to a user defined function to set the 
component class properties (typically named SetProperties).

After the class is loaded, the Initialize function is invoked to perform any static class
initializations.

The class is loaded and initialized and instances of it can be created.
When creating an instance, the Constructor fuction is invoked to register the member functions
and possibly perform any instance initialization (non-gui instances).
For gui instances, the GenerateWindows function is invoked after the constructor to handle all
remaining instance initialization (member function registration should still be performed
at the Constructor function)

When destroying an instance, the Destructor function is invoked to perform any instance cleanup.

When unloading the class, the CleanUp function is invoked to perform any static class cleanup and
then the ClassUnload function is invoked to unload the class.
